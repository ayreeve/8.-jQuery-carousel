# jQuery carousel (RWD)

If you feel dizzy, this project makes it worse (I know this for a fact). Fortunately, you can stop the wild carousel at any moment by mousing over the slider. 

How to use:
1. You can simply do nothing (just admire the beauty of these four slides which I provided) or
2. Take matters into your own hands and click right or left arrows to change slides at your own pace.
3. You may wanna know that taking mouse out result in restart slider (it will be automatically switched again)

Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- RWD
- jQuery
- Git

What’s more?
- my own design
- hypnotic experience
